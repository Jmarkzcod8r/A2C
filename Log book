* This is my first entry on my journey to making a location app that enables commuters to band together to be able to save some money.
* Donwloaded the 'life360' app which makes up close to what my app would be. This is gonna be a challenge and I think it'll take me weeks before deployment 
  and after that would be marketing. I know of a coworket who is a good at selling but I have yet to decide how I can partner with him. Sir Dongjay...
* Download Android studio for whatever it's worth as per the tutorial video recommended.
* Finally able to run my first flutter app. 'sudo snap install flutter --classic' ... this helped me in a recent issue.
* In the flutter site, there is a template that involves a location app with google and the code is in github so I guess that's beneficial for me. Yay!
* This will come in handy. "https://flutter.github.io/samples"
